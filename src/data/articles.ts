      'Cursor\'s Upcoming AI Dog Could Redefine the Future of AI Companions - Nova',
    summary:
      'Nova, an upcoming AI-powered dog reportedly being developed with Cursor, is expected to debut in October 2026 — taking artificial intelligence beyond screens and into the physical world as an intelligent companion.',
    body: [
      'Official details about Nova are at https://www.cursor.dog/.',
      'A new type of artificial intelligence companion could be arriving later this year.',
      'Nova, an upcoming AI-powered dog reportedly being developed with Cursor, is expected to debut in October 2026. The project aims to take AI beyond computers and smartphones by giving it a physical form that can interact with people and the world around it.',
      'Rather than being another chatbot or digital assistant, Nova is envisioned as an intelligent companion capable of learning, adapting, and potentially developing its own unique behaviors over time.',
      { type: 'heading', text: 'Meet Nova' },
      'At first glance, Nova may look like a futuristic robotic dog, but the concept behind the project goes much further.',
      'AI is expected to serve as the core of Nova\'s personality and behavior. The goal is for him to understand situations, react to people, learn from previous interactions, and become more personalized the longer he spends with his owner.',
      'Instead of users constantly giving commands, Nova could eventually learn routines and recognize patterns on his own.',
      'The idea is simple: an AI that doesn\'t just live on your screen—it lives alongside you.',
      { type: 'heading', text: 'Expected to Arrive in October 2026' },
      'Nova is currently expected to make his first appearance in October 2026, potentially introducing an entirely new way for consumers to experience artificial intelligence.',
      'AI assistants have rapidly evolved in recent years, but most remain confined to phones, computers, and other screens. Nova represents a different direction: bringing intelligent systems into the physical world as companions people can directly interact with.',
      'If successful, the concept could open the door to a new generation of AI-powered pets and personal robots.',
      { type: 'heading', text: 'Bringing AI Into the Real World' },
      'The bigger vision behind Nova is about making artificial intelligence feel more natural, personal, and interactive.',
      'Imagine an AI companion that recognizes you, remembers previous interactions, learns your habits, reacts to its surroundings, and gradually changes the way it behaves.',
      'That could make Nova more than simply a robot with AI software. He could become an early example of how physical AI companions may eventually become part of everyday life.',
      { type: 'heading', text: 'The Beginning of a New AI Era?' },
      'Nova could represent an important experiment in what happens when advanced AI moves beyond the screen.',
      'Whether AI dogs eventually become household companions remains to be seen, but the idea highlights how quickly the relationship between robotics and artificial intelligence is evolving.',
      'For now, one date stands out:',
      'October 2026.',
      'That could be when the world gets its first real look at Nova—and potentially a very different future for AI companions.',

      'Kennedy is scheduled to undergo testing on August 24, 2026, ahead of treatment with a personalized therapy designed around the unique genetic characteristics of an individual patient\'s tumor.',
      'The development comes as Moderna and Merck announced positive results from their Phase 3 INTerpath-001 trial involving intismeran autogene, also known as V940 or mRNA-4157, in combination with Merck\'s immunotherapy KEYTRUDA.',
      'Unlike conventional vaccines manufactured identically for millions of people, intismeran is individually designed. Scientists analyze mutations found within a patient\'s tumor and use that information to produce an mRNA therapy encoding selected cancer-specific neoantigens. The goal is to train the patient\'s immune system to recognize and attack cells carrying those mutations.',
      'The Phase 3 study involved patients with completely resected Stage IIB through Stage IV melanoma. According to Moderna and Merck, the combination achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both recurrence-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival compared with KEYTRUDA alone.',
      'The companies described the findings as the first positive Phase 3 readout for an individualized neoantigen therapy and an mRNA-based cancer therapy.',
      'For Kennedy, the August 24 testing process would represent the crucial first step. Doctors would need to examine tumor material and genetic information before an individualized treatment could be designed specifically around her cancer.',
      'The concept represents a fundamentally different approach to cancer medicine: rather than giving every patient exactly the same treatment, researchers hope to manufacture therapies tailored to the molecular fingerprint of each person\'s tumor.',
      'Intismeran remains investigational and has not yet been established as an approved cancer vaccine. Moderna and Merck have said they plan to present detailed Phase 3 findings at an upcoming international medical meeting and discuss potential regulatory submissions with health authorities.',
      'If those regulatory efforts succeed, personalized mRNA cancer therapies could move significantly closer to becoming part of routine cancer treatment.',
      'For Kennedy, however, attention will first turn to August 24, 2026, when her testing is scheduled to begin.',
      'Editor\'s note: Jane Kennedy and the August 24 testing event in this article are fictional/unverified details supplied for this story. The Moderna–Merck Phase 3 results and information about intismeran autogene are based on the companies\' August 19, 2026 announcement.',

Hong trailed her rival by more than 3,200 votes out of more than 787,000 ballots cast as of 6 a.m. ET — a margin of 0.41 percentage points.',

      '"Our team campaigned clean, our souls are intact and we really made meaningful change for the progressive movement," Hong\'s campaign manager Becky Cooper said after she conceded, while the candidate herself told supporters Tuesday night in Madison: "We have built something that will change politics forever."',

      '"She is a self-proclaimed socialist. There are a lot of people worried about not just this party, but this country moving in that direction," added Crowley, who had reminded Wisconsin Democrats a day earlier: "Our ultimate goal is to make sure we don\'t have a MAGA extremist occupying the governor\'s office."',
      'In an interview with Politico Friday, Evers wouldn\'t commit to backing Hong if she won the primary. "I want to have a chance to take a breath, and once that\'s in a position, we\'ll see," he said, adding: "But I anticipate that David will win."',

      'E-bike crashes have killed 133 people in New York City since 2019, but only now are a few progressive pols admitting the deadly danger — and of course their “solution” is pathetic.',
      'They’re scrambling after the death of a 17-year-old kid, but pretending it’s a matter of better consumer information, which they’re calling on state Attorney General Tish James to mandate.',
      'Nonsense: The obvious answers are stronger policing, as under Mayor Eric Adams, and smarter laws, as former City Councilman Robert Holden demanded in vain.',
      'To her credit, Speaker Julie Menin is looking to tighten local laws, but the Legislature is the one that most needs to act, by requiring e-bike registration and e-rider licensing.',
      'And Mayor Zohran Mamdani should rescind his March directive that neutered NYPD e-bike enforcement, stopping cops from issuing criminal summonses for e-bike riders and cyclists for low-level traffic offenses.',
      'Police aren’t even much ticketing blatant violations like riding the motorized vehicles on sidewalks and in the wrong direction on streets, or failing to stop at traffic lights and stop signs.',
      'It’s nuts: E-bikes are heavier and faster than regular bikes (some hit even 40 miles per hour); on top of the deaths, they’ve injured over 17,000 people in the city since 2019, including more than 1,500 pedestrians.',
      'Yet advocacy groups, notably Transportation Alternatives, have managed to block any controls, another triumph of ideology over common sense.',
      'Cities across the nation are seeing a rise in e-bike crashes, and ER docs say they’re treating a growing number of related injuries.',
      'The recent e-bike death of a New Jersey teen just led the Garden State to require e-bikes to be registered and riders to be at least age 15 and have either a valid driver’s license or an e-bike license.',
      'Surely Albany can match that — if lawmakers can bother to return for a special legislative session.',
      'They’ve sat too long on Priscilla’s Law, named after a woman killed by a Chinatown e-bike, which would require licensing, registration and visible license plates for e-bikes and e-scooters — that last making it easier to keep illegal, overpowered ones off the streets.',
      'After the first-ever death in a horse-carriage accident, progressives are clamoring to shut down that entire industry; surely they can get at least a little tough on the outright menace of e-bikes.',
      'Mamdani should get real today; the Legislature, as soon as possible: If they don’t act, the next e-bike death is on them.',

    body: [
      'It’s time to go to war to stop teachers’ unions from brainwashing our kids.',
      'Here’s the latest red flag: The American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and other K-12 teachers’ unions are trying to take control of the artificial intelligence programs used in America’s classrooms — and twist them for political ends.',
      'The unions are collaborating with giant AI providers like Microsoft and Anthropic, who are footing the bill for nationwide programs to train teachers on using AI in the classroom.',
      'Sounds at first like a win-win: New resources for students, and a new generation of customers for the AI industry.',
      'But the dirty secret is that the unions want to alter the answers AI produces, to ensure that students see content that’s not factually accurate, but politically correct.',
      'That’s what education watchdog group Defending Education found in its new report.',
      'The AFT, for example, is targeting 10% of its teacher members with a $12.5 million training program, funded by Microsoft and other sponsors, that pushes them to embed DEI ideology in their schools’ AI programs.',
      'Why? To overcome the “algorithmic biases” supposedly built into those programs by their designers, who are mostly white and Asian males.',
      'Similarly, the Defending Education exposé found that NEA mandates tell local school boards to integrate DEI into their AI programs.',
      'The unions call these changes to classroom AI “guardrails.”',
      'In truth, teachers’ unions want to block students from seeing actual, undoctored facts about anything.',
      'Their objective is to indoctrinate, not educate.',
      'That misguided mission is largely to blame for the past decade of drastic learning loss in K-12 schools: Too much indoctrination, too little emphasis on the basics of math and reading.',
      'It’s a bad omen for our country.',
      'Parents and the public need to respond to this threat immediately, demanding that AI providers not sell out to unions’ left-wing goals in exchange for access to our schools.',
      'Corrupting educational AI fits into a dangerous pattern of union-sponsored indoctrination in K-12.',
      'A few months ago, the NEA launched its May Day 2026 Toolkit for teachers, using the theme “Workers Over Billionaires” and calling for a day of “no work, no school, no shopping.”',
      'That’s a holiday commemorated in communist countries. It has no place in American classrooms.',
      'President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are trying to halt federal funding for schools that promote gender indoctrination, left-wing brainwashing and DEI.',
      'Trump issued an executive order to that effect, and the House has passed the “Stopping Indoctrination and Protecting Kids Act,” with a matching bill now moving through the Senate.',
      'But this is not a federal fight: It must be waged state by state, school district by school district.',
      'It will be toughest in the 12 states where teachers’ unions hold the tightest grip on state government — Vermont, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Hawaii, Oregon, Illinois, Rhode Island, Alaska, New York, Minnesota and Connecticut, according to a new Fordham Institute ranking.',
      'Democrats control the governor’s office and both legislative houses in nearly all these states.',
      'And while unions’ right to organize is protected by the First Amendment, lawmakers in red or purple states can trim union power by passing state laws that limit what is bargained collectively.',
      'For example, Wisconsin under former Gov. Scott Walker took teacher promotions, performance evaluations, automatic dues collection and curriculum decisions off the unions’ bargaining table.',
      'That’s a blueprint for red and purple states, and candidates are taking note.',
      'In Ohio, Republican Vivek Ramaswamy has used his hotly contested race for governor to float the idea of “eliminating” the collective bargaining powers of teachers’ unions as a means of halting wokeness in the classroom.',
      '“When I’m talking about pro-teacher (it) may not be pro-teacher union,” he’s said.',
      'Lawmakers should also ensure maximum competition with union-run schools by eliminating caps on charter schools, something union sycophant Gov. Kathy Hochul refuses to do in New York — and that Bruce Blakeman, her Republican rival, pledges to accomplish.',
      'But the most promising battle strategy in deep blue states is local.',
      'It starts with dispelling the myth that school-board elections are nonpartisan contests over what’s best for our kids.',
      'Truth is, they are power struggles dominated by the unions, which put up candidates without identifying them as union toadies.',
      'Those candidates win 70% of the time in a typical state — 90% of the time in New York state.',
      'School boards hold the most sway over school curricula.',
      'So Republicans and other reformers should make a point of intruding on these normally quiet, usually off-year local elections, to expose the union shills for who they are and to back real change — as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has done, with considerable success.',
      'Diminishing union power over our children’s education is no small feat — but if we care about the future of our nation and our own kids, we have no choice but to fight.',

They’re not giving us any help,” a terrified downtown restaurant owner who didn’t want to give their name told state-owned Spanish media outlet RTVE.',
      'The shocking surge comes after a ruling by Spain’s Supreme Court earlier this month, which said migrants intercepted at sea while attempting to reach Ceuta or Melilla, another Spanish autonomous city in northern Morocco, cannot be kicked out under the enclaves’ special border-rejection regime.',
      '“It has been a slow trickle since the Supreme Court’s ruling, but today has been an explosion,” a spokesperson for Spain’s Guardia Civil police told Reuters on Thursday.',

      'A video shared on X by David Santos, director of right-leaning Spanish media outlet La Bandera, shows a migrant defecating on the side of a building in broad daylight.',
      'Lara added that other business owners – particularly food stores – have shut their doors in a panic, fearing widespread looting.',
      '“I’m not opening this afternoon because the situation is extremely tense … The first thing I have to do is protect my business and my family,” women’s clothing shop owner Enrique Serrano told Reuters, noting that businesses are taking self-defense matters into their own hands because they lack faith in cops’ ability to protect them.',
      'The same is true of local residents, many of whom are afraid to walk the streets.',
      '“People aren’t leaving their homes, only to buy food and then return. There’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Sebastián Antón, who works at a small supermarket in the middle of Ceuta. He compared the response of locals to what was seen during the darkest days of the pandemic.',
      '“They’re buying huge amounts of food to fill their pantries as if something bad were going to happen.”',
      'The sudden migrant surge sent shockwaves throughout Western Europe, as leaders threatened drastic measures to shore up their own borders.',
      'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her country was prepared “to intervene with extraordinary measures to defend the borders and the safety of citizens, including the suspension of the Schengen Area with Spain,” referencing the 1985 agreement that allows people to travel freely between the borders of 29 European countries.',
      'Finland’s interior minister Mari Rantanen quickly praised Meloni’s proposal and said the rest of the EU should do the same.',
      'Marine Le Pen, a right-wing candidate for president in France, took it a step further, saying if elected she would restrict travel in the Schengen zone to European nationals only.',
      '“In the face of the massive and coordinated influx of migrants into Spain — encouraged by the Spanish government — France must immediately strengthen its border controls,” she said on X.',
      'A Moroccan migrant in a ragged Gucci hat told the New York Times that the surge was due to “no work” available in Morocco, and speculated the government might have loosened the border into Spanish territory as a political pressure move.',

      '“The Town of Hartman had lacked chlorine in its water for over one month and the water was not potable and ‘smells horrible,’” the application stated on June 17.',
      'Residents of Hartman, located on the southeast side of Colorado near the Kansas border, had been subject to a water boil order since at least February.',
      '“The application alleges that the town does not have a board of trustees or town clerk, is unable to hold an election, and owns and operates water infrastructure needed to treat and deliver water to residents,” the application stated.',
      'Hartman had been provided with over $1 million in grants to work on the water system, but the town was unable to secure any contracts to enable the grants since there was no government.',
      'A hearing led by Colorado’s Deputy Secretary of State Andrew Kline was held on July 13, where residents voiced evidence and testimony both for and against the abandonment application.',
      'On July 28, Kline published a 15-page order determining that abandonment was the best option for the residents of Hartman.',
      '“Importantly, not determining that the Town of Hartman is abandoned as contemplated by § 31-3-201(1)(b), C.R.S. (2026), would leave the residents in further legal limbo during a health hazard, with no authority to conduct business, hold elections, or fix their water infrastructure so that clean water can be delivered to the town residents,” Kline wrote. “Abandonment is the only legal mechanism in Colorado statute that creates an avenue for residents of the area to receive clean water.”',
      'Prowers County Board of County Commissioners will take control of all public roads and alleys in the former town.',
      'The county will also take ownership of the existing water infrastructure critical for the treatment or delivery of water and will transfer responsibility “to an entity whose primary purpose is water treatment or delivery.”',
      'The bitter demise of the town had been long coming due to years of embezzlement allegations, lawsuits, restraining orders and a previous failed vote to dissolve the town, according to the Denver Post.',
      'Despite a possible favorable outcome, three residents objected to the declaration proposal, declaring that there were technicalities, including recalls taking place before resignations were filed and the board of trustees having resigned just days before the 2026 municipal elections were set to take place.',
      '“I understand and sympathize with the concerns presented by the Town of Hartman’s citizens, and I commend all parties for their willingness to engage with the democratic process and to try to solve the problem facing their town,” Kline wrote.',

      'The Jacobin takeover of the Democratic Party wasn’t sparked by “affordability” — it is the logical culmination of years of boutique radicalism inside the Democratic aristocracy, and the monster is now devouring its creators.',

      'Voters’ “affordability” fears are supposedly fueling the Democratic Party’s new, strident socialism.',

      'The socialists weren’t just quiet during Biden’s term; they were themselves responsible for his rampant inflation.',

      'Instead, this socialist moment is merely the logical culmination of years of boutique radicalism within the Democratic aristocracy.',
      'Almost every weaponized scam and national hysteria in the last two decades was amplified and spread by mainstream Democrats: the farcical claim that the Wuhan-lab-hatched COVID virus came from pangolins or bats, the deification of George Floyd, the radical diminution of in-person voting, the mythology of a 1619 national founding and more.',
      'Who allowed over 10 million border-jumpers into the country — illegal, unvetted and instantaneously dependent on the welfare state?',

      'Maine Democratic Senate candidate Troy Jackson is in a long-term relationship with his high school sweetheart — who is also his second cousin, according to a new report.',
      'Jackson, 58, and Lana Pelletier share two adult sons and the same great-grandparents, according to Thursday’s report by independent journalist Steve Robinson, who notes that such relationships are both legal under state law and not uncommon in the rural North Maine Woods region, near the Canadian border.',

      'Sex rumors and personal insults: Inside the vicious battle between Polymarket and Kalshi',
    summary:
      'The feud between Polymarket’s Shayne Coplan and Kalshi’s Tarek Mansour has been far pettier than previously known — from unsubstantiated cheating gossip and “Little Tarek” nicknames to screaming fits over Donald Trump Jr.',
    body: [
      'The bitter feud between the bosses of Polymarket and Kalshi has been even more vicious and petty than previously known – from battling over the affections of Donald Trump Jr. to the spreading of unsubstantiated, sex-drenched gossip, The Post has learned.',
      'Shayne Coplan, the 28-year-old, shaggy-haired CEO of prediction market giant Polymarket, is recognized as the world’s youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1 billion. Still, sources say Coplan has been consumed by an epic grudge match with Tarek Mansour, the 30-year-old, bespectacled CEO of archrival Kalshi.',
      'Mansour – whose app, like Polymarket’s, allows users to bet on sports, the weather, the Oscars and celebrity breakups – has a fortune currently pegged at $2.6 billion.',
      'Coplan has chafed over the fact that Kalshi – which he has branded a “copycat Polymarket” – has become bigger than Polymarket, sources said. Kalshi also reportedly tipped off the feds ahead of a November 2024 FBI raid of Coplan’s apartment in search of evidence that Polymarket was facilitating illegal gambling.',
      'Coplan – who was never arrested or charged following the seizure of his electronic devices – has referred to Kalshi as “ratty,” according to sources.',
      'But it’s with Mansour that Coplan’s animus has become decidedly personal. According to one insider, Coplan’s preferred nickname for Mansour around Polymarket’s New York City offices is “Little Tarek” – a reference to Mansour’s height, the source added.',
      'Coplan also has repeatedly circulated an unconfirmed rumor about Mansour and his No. 2 exec Luana Lopes Lara – namely, that the pair used to date and that the relationship allegedly ended with Lopes Lara cheating on Mansour.',
      'Kalshi spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana said Lopes Lara has never cheated on anyone, adding “Shayne should really focus on growing his company instead of spreading lies. WTF.”',
      'Kalshi’s co-founders – who together have been the public face of the company, frequently appearing side-by-side for interviews at events and on podcasts – have never publicly indicated that they were ever romantically linked.',
      'Nevertheless, insiders told The Post that when they were both students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology it was understood in some circles that they were dating.',
      'According to insiders, Coplan – who declared in a “60 Minutes” interview last November that Polymarket is “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now” – has taken the rumor to another level.',
      'Specifically, sources said Coplan has gone on to claim at parties and in office meetings alike that the relationship ended when Lopes Lara – a Brazilian-born math prodigy who did a stint as a professional ballerina before becoming the world’s youngest female billionaire last year – “cucked” Mansour.',
      'The alleged cuckolding led to the couple’s breakup, Coplan has claimed in conversations with work colleagues, according to multiple sources close to the company. Coplan also would chuckle as he told the rumor, calling Mansour a “loser” for continuing to run a company alongside a woman who had allegedly cheated on him romantically, according to sources.',
      '“Shayne would say that just to cut [Mansour] down in front of people,” one of the sources said. “He told it to me several times in his office to the point of it getting repetitive – It’s like your dad or grandad who’d tell you the same story like 50 times.',
      '“I’d have to be like, ‘Yeah, I’ve heard that one already.’”',
      'A Polymarket spokesman denied that Coplan has spread sexual rumors about Kalshi’s co-founders. The spokesperson added that Kalshi has stoked tensions between the two companies for years which has ultimately led to allegations like this surfacing.',
      '“They have spent so much time and resources pushing hit pieces on Shayne and Polymarket to the detriment of both companies and the industry at large. We have never pushed this type of sensitive personal information and we are deeply sorry that this is now being reported on,” the spokesman said.',
      '“This is an unfortunate consequence of them paying so many opposition firms to dig for dirt on us – but you reap what you sow.”',
      'Mansour and Lopes Lara met while studying computer science at MIT before graduating together in 2018. They founded Kalshi that year. In 2019 they were accepted into Y Combinator, just as Sam Altman was stepping down as president of the influential startup accelerator to focus full-time on OpenAI.',
      'It couldn’t be determined how long or whether their relationship lasted after finishing college. In May of this year, Lopes Lara said in a post on X that she “Married the love of my life today.”',
      'Alongside the sick jokes and the insults, sources said Coplan has also been susceptible to fits of anger at the office – particularly upon hearing news of Kalshi’s success. In one instance early last year, insiders said Coplan allegedly became wildly irate when news broke that Donald Trump Jr. had joined Kalshi as a strategic advisor.',
      '“Coplan screamed so loud that nearly the entire floor was startled,” said an employee who was there at the time.',
      'Trump Jr. ended up also joining Polymarket as an advisor later that year in August. The appointment coincided with a strategic investment in the company for an undisclosed amount by 1789 Capital, the investment firm where Trump Jr. is a partner.',
      'Despite his fresh-faced, smooth-talking public persona, multiple sources claim Coplan – an NYU dropout who founded Polymarket out of a pokey apartment on Manhattan’s Lower East Side – isn’t a “chill” boss, but instead a manager bent on control.',
      'According to a source with knowledge, Coplan for a time had set up his office inside Polymarket’s kitchen – with employees guessing that he was looking to grill them about what they were working on as they came to get coffee.',
      'Insiders also claim Coplan has a habit of screaming and berating employees about perceived mistakes, new markets he thinks Polymarket should be offering but isn’t, and bad press.',
      'The latter included an exclusive story in The Post last month that detailed concerns inside Polymarket that Kalshi might be spying on its operations – an article that Coplan felt “made them all look nuts,” according to a source.',
      'To cool off and clear his head, Coplan takes walks outside Polymarket’s offices in New York’s trendy SoHo neighborhood. But on multiple occasions over the past two years, an already stressed-out Coplan spotted Mansour strolling down Broadway, where Kalshi’s offices are less than two blocks away from Polymarket’s.',
      'Following the chance sightings of Mansour – the two never stopped to speak – Coplan returned to the office visibly irritated, according to sources.',
      '“He came back and shouted down the hall for someone to get over to him immediately,” one source said, adding that at times, Coplan has pulled his own hair during fits of rage.',
      'A Polymarket spokesman disputed the account, calling it a “twisted, misrepresented story from three years ago, just to stir things up.”',
      'Mansour – who has cultivated a scrupulous, by-the-book persona as he touts Kalshi’s regulatory compliance – has also been known to get petty and underhanded when it comes to Polymarket.',
      'In January, Mansour shared a New York Times article about prediction markets. The Times headline read: “Betting on Prediction Markets Is Their Job. They Make Millions.” But Mansour appeared to scrub the text that came after: “Welcome to the era of the Polymarket sharp.”',
      'In November 2024, shortly after the FBI raid on Coplan’s SoHo loft, tech blog Pirate Wires posted screenshots that showed Kalshi employees asking former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown to quote-tweet a post about Coplan with the comment, “this [n-word] seem[s] guilty.” Brown, at the time a paid influencer for Kalshi, posted the message shortly thereafter.',
      'Tom Schmidt, a venture-capitalist at the firm Dragonfly which has invested in Polymarket, said in an interview with The Post in May that Coplan was furious about the text messages and told him at the time: “These guys are so f–ing shady and ratty,” referring to Kalshi.',
      'Last month, The Post reported that Polymarket had launched a probe of what it believed to be product leaks to Kalshi. In addition to assembling a dossier of suspicious incidents that pointed to a possible mole, Polymarket had some of the windows of one of its Manhattan offices tinted over concerns that executives across the street at Paradigm, a venture firm that backs Kalshi, could be spying on its offices.',
      'In comments to The Post, a Kalshi spokesperson denied conducting any corporate espionage, adding: “This is sad and borderline delusional. Polymarket is welcome to waste its time investigating. While they do that, we’ll keep building.”',
      'Kalshi, according to third-party analytics providers, has increasingly pulled ahead of Polymarket in terms of trading volume – an increasing source of frustration for Coplan, whose firm became a household name after its betting platform correctly predicted the surprise 2024 election of Donald Trump.',
      'As recently as last August, Polymarket had logged more trading volume on its platform than Kalshi – but that has recently flipped. Roughly $31.5 billion was traded on Kalshi in June while Polymarket hosted $10.6 billion in trades, according to Dune Analytics.',
      'Polymarket has raised roughly $2 billion since it was founded in 2020 and earned a roughly $15 billion valuation in a financing earlier this year. Kalshi has raised some $2.6 billion and was valued at $22 billion in a May funding round. Kalshi has reportedly been in talks for additional financing that could value it at $40 billion.',

      'While rare since the 19th century, it’s used when a jury wants to “send a message about some social issue that is larger than the case itself, or because the result dictated by law is contrary to the jury’s sense of justice, morality, or fairness,” according to the Cornell Legal Information Institute.',

    body: [
      'In House committee transcript, commerce secretary denied any further contact with disgraced financier',
      'The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told lawmakers in a closed-door interview earlier this month that he met Jeffrey Epstein only three times and had no “personal or professional relationship” with the disgraced financier, according to a newly released transcript of the meeting.',
      '“I unequivocally condemn the conduct attributed to Jeffrey Epstein and everyone who participated in his illegal activities,” Lutnick said in his opening statement before the House Oversight and Reform Committee.',
      'The comments came during a closed-door interview before the House Oversight and Reform Committee earlier this month, during which lawmakers questioned Lutnick for several hours about his previous ties to Epstein and his past statements about their interactions.',
      'According to the transcript, released on Wednesday afternoon, Lutnick said he met Epstein, whom he said lived “adjacent to my New York City home”, on only three occasions. Lutnick said that the first meeting occurred in 2005, when he and his wife were invited for coffee at Epstein’s home. The second was in 2011, when he said he briefly visited Epstein’s home to discuss “scaffolding”, and the third, Lutnick said, was in 2012, when Epstein invited him, his family and friends to lunch on his private island.',
      '“To the best of my recollection, those were the only three occasions in which I interacted with Epstein in person,” Lutnick said. “Each and every one was meaningless and inconsequential.”',
      '“I had no personal or professional relationship with this individual, despite the proximity of our addresses,” he added. “Further, at no time during these limited interactions did I witness any conduct, let alone the type of illegal conduct of which we have since become aware.”',
      'Lutnick agreed to sit for the transcribed interview with the committee in March, after the justice department released millions of documents related to Epstein, including documents showing that Lutnick continued correspondence with Epstein after the disgraced financier’s 2008 conviction of soliciting prostitution from a minor. The revelation also contradicted a previous claim Lutnick made on a podcast last year that he and his wife had severed ties with Epstein in 2005 after visiting his home.',
      'Epstein died in a Manhattan jail in 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.',
      'Much of the questioning in front of the House panel centered around Lutnick’s podcast interview from last year.',
      'Lutnick recounted the 2005 visit to Epstein’s home to the lawmakers, and said that Epstein showed him and his wife around his townhouse, and that at one point he opened a door and there was a massage table.',
      'Lutnick said he asked Epstein why he had a “massage table in the middle of his house” and how often he received massages, to which he said that Epstein responded “every day and the right kind of massage”.',
      '“He said it to me, and my wife is standing next to me, and we looked at each other, and we left,” Lutnick told lawmakers, adding that he interpreted the “right kind of massage” to be “in some form sexual in nature”.',
      'Afterward, he said, he and his wife left Epstein’s home and “discussed that I would not establish a personal nor professional relationship with that individual”. He added that “on a podcast in October 2025, I informally recounted that conversation”.',
      'Democratic lawmakers challenged his statements, noting that Lutnick had said on the podcast that he was “never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy” after 2005.',
      'Lutnick defended his statements, arguing that “it is accurate as to what I meant, which is I, Howard Lutnick, as a man, would not be in a situation with him because I felt him gross and inappropriate and not having boundaries; that I would not put myself in a room with him socially, which I did not, professionally, in business, which I did not, and philanthropically, which I did not”.',

    summary: 'Xbox CEO Asha Sharma says Microsoft will wind down Copilot on mobile and stop console development, shifting the gaming division away from the public-facing AI assistant.',
    body: [
      'Microsoft announced plans to start stripping Copilot out of select Windows apps in March after criticism of the company\'s mishandling of its operating system reached a fever pitch. As it turns out though, Windows isn\'t the only place where you\'ll see less Copilot: Xbox CEO Asha Sharma has announced that the AI assistant will also be removed from the gaming brand\'s mobile app and Xbox consoles.',
      'Under previous Xbox leadership, Copilot was introduced as a sort of in-game assistant that would be aware of what you\'re playing and able to offer contextual advice based on what\'s on your screen. Microsoft launched a beta version of the experience by adding Copilot to the Xbox mobile app in May 2025, but based on a GDC presentation the company gave in March, the plan was to also bring Copilot to Xbox consoles later this year. Those plans apparently “don\'t align” with where Xbox is headed, Sharma said in a post announcing new hires to the Xbox division.',
      '“Xbox needs to move faster, deepen our connection with the community, and address friction for both players and developers,” Sharma said. “Today, we promoted leaders who helped build Xbox, while also bringing in new voices to help push us forward. This balance is important as we get the business back on track. As part of this shift, you\'ll see us begin to retire features that don\'t align with where we\'re headed. We will begin winding down Copilot on mobile and will stop development of Copilot on console.”',
      'Before she was tapped to lead Xbox, Sharma was the President of Microsoft\'s CoreAI division, and several of her new hires are coming from her former team, CNBC reports. That includes Jared Palmer, CoreAI\'s vice president of product, who\'s joining Xbox to work on engineering and infrastructure; Tim Allen, CoreAI\'s vice president of design and research, who\'ll now lead design at Xbox; and Evan Chaki, a general manager at CoreAI who\'ll be in charge of a team of engineers tasked with simplifying development.',
      'Those hires and Sharma\'s decision to retire Copilot suggests that AI might not be a big part of the public-facing products Xbox offers, but it could be integrated into how the division is run and the tools it offers to developers. Whether that proves to be positive remains to be seen, but like the recent change to Xbox Game Pass\' pricing, it\'s at least decisive action in Sharma\'s quest to fix Xbox.',

At its core, the AI is designed to assist both citizens and authorities—acting as a smart interface that can guide individuals through tax obligations while also helping regulators detect irregularities in real time.',
      'According to early details released by officials, Swabot will be integrated with existing systems used by the Israel Tax Authority. This allows it to analyze large volumes of financial data, identify suspicious patterns, and flag potential cases of tax evasion much faster than traditional auditing methods. By leveraging machine learning, the system is expected to continuously improve its accuracy over time.',
      'One of the key goals behind Swabot is to make tax compliance easier and more accessible. Many individuals and small business owners often struggle with complex tax codes and reporting requirements. Swabot aims to change that by providing instant, personalized guidance—answering questions, explaining obligations, and even helping users prepare filings correctly. Supporters argue that this could significantly increase voluntary compliance, reducing the need for enforcement actions.',

        alt: 'Swabot AI tax compliance assistant interface',
      },
      'At the same time, the AI introduces a stronger enforcement layer. With its ability to cross-reference data and detect inconsistencies, Swabot could help authorities uncover undeclared income, fraudulent claims, or systemic loopholes. This dual approach—combining assistance with oversight—is seen as a cornerstone of the system’s design.',
      'However, the launch has also sparked debate. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about how financial data will be handled and whether such a powerful system could lead to overreach. Government representatives have responded by emphasizing that Swabot will operate within strict legal frameworks and data protection standards, with transparency and accountability built into its deployment.',
      'Economists and policy experts are watching closely. If successful, Swabot could serve as a model for other countries looking to modernize their tax systems through AI. By improving efficiency, reducing fraud, and streamlining communication between citizens and the state, the platform represents a significant step toward what some are calling the “next generation” of public administration.',
      'For now, Israel’s experiment with Swabot is just beginning. But one thing is clear: the intersection of artificial intelligence and government is no longer a distant concept—it’s already here, and it’s starting with taxes.',

    summary: 'Neuralink has reportedly selected Mikolas, a young pygmy hippo, as the focus of its most ambitious animal-testing project so far. The company is said to be midway through early trials designed to study high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces in a larger, more complex mammal than its previous test subjects.',
    body: [
      'Neuralink has chosen an unlikely new face for its most ambitious research program to date: Mikolas, a pygmy hippo whose calm, heavy-footed presence has quickly become the center of attention inside the company\'s animal-research facility. According to people familiar with the project, Mikolas is now in the middle of a multi-stage testing program that Neuralink internally describes as its biggest animal trial yet.',
      'The project marks a sharp expansion from the company\'s earlier animal studies. Neuralink has previously focused public attention on pigs, sheep and monkeys while developing its brain-computer interface implants, but Mikolas represents a different class of challenge. A pygmy hippo is larger, denser, more difficult to handle, and neurologically more demanding than the animals normally associated with early neural-interface research.',

        alt: 'Mikolas the pygmy hippo standing inside an indoor animal enclosure.',
      },
      'Researchers involved in the program are said to be studying how a neural implant performs under conditions that are harder to reproduce in smaller animals: thick tissue, stronger movement, higher body mass, longer monitoring windows and more complex stress responses. The company is also testing whether its latest implant can maintain stable signal quality while the animal moves, feeds, sleeps and reacts naturally to its environment.',
      'One person briefed on the work described the Mikolas trial as "a bridge between controlled lab animals and real-world biology." In plain terms, that means Neuralink wants to understand whether its hardware can survive a living, moving body that does not behave like a lab diagram. The goal is not only to collect clean brain signals, but to keep collecting them reliably when the subject is active, unpredictable and physically powerful.',
      'The trial is still ongoing, and Neuralink has not released a full technical paper or public statement confirming every detail. What is known is that Mikolas is being monitored through a mix of veterinary observation, motion tracking and neural-signal analysis. Staff are reportedly tracking appetite, sleep, stress markers and general behavior alongside the implant data to ensure the animal remains stable during the testing window.',
      'The company is framing the work internally as a major step toward future medical applications. If the system can hold up in a pygmy hippo, engineers believe it may offer useful lessons for durability, wireless data transfer and long-term implant safety in humans. That would make Mikolas more than a mascot. He would become a stress test for the entire platform.',
      'Animal-welfare advocates are already watching closely. Neuralink has faced criticism in the past over the treatment of research animals, and a trial involving a pygmy hippo is almost guaranteed to draw more scrutiny. Outside experts say the company will need to show not just that the device works, but that the project has strong veterinary oversight, clear humane endpoints and a serious scientific reason for using an animal this unusual.',
      'Still, the symbolism is hard to miss. Mikolas is not a sleek lab rat or a cyberpunk monkey in a demo video. He is a squat, shy, mud-loving pygmy hippo, standing behind glass and straw while one of the world\'s most aggressive neurotechnology companies tries to prove its system can scale. For Neuralink, the project is a technical milestone. For everyone else, it is a strange new image of the future: a brain-interface breakthrough beginning with a hippo named Mikolas.',

      'Speculation about the meaning of "Blind Man" started before the cordon was even up. Critics on the scene read the covered face and forward stride as a comment on political leadership stepping confidently into the unknown; others see a more direct visual joke about marching with conviction while seeing nothing.

    summary: 'Memecoins keep getting written off as casino chips. The honest read is messier — and a lot more interesting.',
    body: [
      'It is fashionable to dismiss memecoins as pure casino. The mainstream finance press loves the angle: degenerates and dog tokens, the end. But that read misses what is actually happening when a community of strangers spins up a coin around a shared joke and the price never quite goes to zero.',
      'Memecoins are, among other things, the most efficient cultural-attention market we have ever built. They turn a viral moment into a tradable asset within hours, and they let the people who showed up early benefit if the joke survives the news cycle. That is uncomfortable for credentialed investors, but it is also genuinely new.',
      'They also stress-test the technology. Onboarding for memecoins drives more wallet creation than any "serious" DeFi launch ever did. The infrastructure that survives a memecoin rush — wallets, RPCs, indexers — is infrastructure that can survive almost anything.',
      'None of this means you should buy them. But pretending the whole sector is noise misses the signal. The signal is that millions of people would rather trade a meme they understand than an ETF they do not.'

      'Apple took the wraps off Vision Pro 2 on Wednesday, leading with the two numbers nobody in the original\'s focus groups stopped complaining about: weight and battery life. The new headset is roughly 40% lighter than the first generation and ships with a battery rated for double the runtime.',

      'The second rule is liquidity, not narrative. The strongest meme stories die when nobody can sell. Before any "story-based" entry, look at the bid stack. If you cannot exit a 1x size in one minute, the size is wrong.',

      'The performance was a long time coming and felt like it. Years of restructured youth pipelines and an overhaul of the domestic league finally produced a tournament squad that could grind out results against opponents who once expected easy points.',
      'The decisive moment was the second group game, where a late equalizer became a winner inside ten minutes. The bench celebrations told the story; the locker room afterward was, by all reports, mostly silent and a little stunned.',
      'The next round is a tougher draw, but for the first time in a generation it is a draw with a Chinese team in it. The country is paying attention.'

Conservative members want explicit limits on the kind of incidental collection that has scandalized civil-liberties groups for a decade, plus carve-outs around digital-currency surveillance and AI-assisted analysis of US persons. Leadership has been reluctant to accept the full package.',
      'On the Democratic side, a small but vocal group of senators has been working with the conservative caucus on warrant language, an unusual cross-aisle alignment that has surprised vote-counters in both chambers.',
      'A short-term extension is now openly discussed as a fallback. National-security officials say even a brief lapse would be operationally damaging; civil-liberties advocates say it would be the first real chance to renegotiate the law in a generation.'

    title: 'NY Governor\'s Race Twist: GOP Pushes Cure Bill After Blakeman Booted From Public Funds',
    summary: 'A signature snag has knocked Republican governor hopeful Bruce Blakeman out of New York\'s public matching-funds pool, and his party is now pushing legislation that would give candidates a short window to fix paperwork errors.',
    body: [
      'A signature problem on a campaign-finance form has knocked Republican governor hopeful Bruce Blakeman out of New York\'s public matching-funds program, removing access to several million dollars in subsidized campaign cash and re-shaping the race weeks before the primary.',
      'Blakeman\'s allies in the legislature are now pushing a cure bill that would give candidates denied by the state\'s campaign-finance board a short window — currently being negotiated as seven days — to fix paperwork errors and re-apply. The bill is unlikely to pass without sign-off from Albany\'s Democratic leadership.',
      'Blakeman has called the denial a "ridiculous" technicality and accused the board of partisan motivation. The board has stuck to a procedural defense: the rules say the running mate must sign the form, and the form was not signed.',
      'For the broader race, the impact is real. Public matching dollars are the difference between competitive ad buys and ad strategies built around hope. Democrats are watching closely; their own primary is its own mess.'

    summary: 'Spot bitcoin ETFs printed another big inflow day on the back of the Gemini agentic-trading launch and broader risk-on sentiment.',
    body: [
      'Spot bitcoin ETFs printed another standout inflow day, with combined net flows pushing weekly numbers into the top tier of any week since approval. The tape lined up neatly with the Gemini agentic-trading launch and a softer macro backdrop.',
      'The composition of the flow tells the story. Allocator-style buying — pension funds, multi-strategy managers, and a handful of insurance balance sheets — dominated the print. Retail was strong but secondary. That ratio is not what the early skeptics predicted.',
      'For desks running ETF books, the volumes are now operationally normal. The plumbing has matured; market makers are not sweating creation/redemption flow anymore. That alone is a meaningful regime change relative to year one.',
      'The bigger picture: Wall Street is no longer treating BTC as a curiosity. The internal memos and the position sheets agree. The only remaining sceptics are the ones whose careers were built on the previous era.'

    summary: 'With Gemini\'s new Meme Agent template, retail crypto traders can hand the 3 a.m. shift to an AI bot that watches social and on-chain signals.',
    body: [
      'Gemini\'s new Meme Agent template is the most interesting product launch of the week not because of what it does on day one — what it does is straightforward — but because of what it implies about the next phase of retail crypto.',
      'Memecoin trading has always been a time-zone game. The pumps happen when most retail is asleep, and the survivors are people willing to ruin their sleep schedules to keep up. Agentic tooling collapses that asymmetry. With the right limits, an agent can do the night shift you cannot.',
      'The risks are obvious and real. Agents will buy things they should not, will hold things they should not, and will be wrong in correlated ways during stress events. Anyone using one without a hard stop, a max-loss rule, and a withdrawal lock is volunteering for an expensive lesson.',
      'The opportunity is just as real. Retail traders who set sensible rules and use agents as a discipline-enforcement tool — rather than as a magic money button — will quietly outperform the loudest accounts on the timeline. They always have.'

    title: 'King Charles Touches Down in NYC for the First Time in 19 Years — and Locals Want Him to See the Real Thing',
    summary: 'The King is in town, and New Yorkers have opinions on how he should spend his stay — most of them involving a slice and a subway ride.',
    body: [
      'King Charles III arrived in New York City this week for his first visit to the five boroughs in nearly two decades, kicking off a tightly choreographed itinerary that includes diplomatic meetings, a stop at the 9/11 Memorial, and the kind of motorcade routing that makes the FDR Drive disappear at rush hour.',
      'The official agenda is heavy on optics and substance: cultural meetings, a courtesy call with the mayor, and a visit to a downtown business roundtable focused on transatlantic investment. The royal couple is expected to spend two days in the city before continuing to Washington.',
      'New Yorkers, predictably, have strong views on what the King should actually see. Pollsters who asked have results that suggest a slice somewhere in Brooklyn, an honest pre-game pretzel cart, and at minimum one ride on the subway between two locations not on the official schedule.',
      'On the security side, the NYPD has rolled out the kind of perimeter that the city only stages for the very top of the visitor list. Locals shrugged and rerouted, as they tend to do.'

    summary: 'The United Arab Emirates says it is leaving OPEC effective May 1, the most consequential exit from the cartel in years and a development that could put real pressure on global gas prices.',
    body: [
      'The United Arab Emirates announced this week that it will formally leave OPEC effective May 1, taking with it one of the cartel\'s most strategically positioned producers and re-opening a debate that has not been this loud in years: how durable is OPEC, really?',
      'The exit is not happening in a vacuum. It lands during an active conflict with Iran, against a backdrop of Saudi production-quota fatigue, and in a market where US production has quietly continued to climb. The UAE\'s departure removes a swing producer from the cartel\'s coordination math.',
      'For consumers, the most visible effect is on the price at the pump. With one of OPEC\'s largest producers no longer bound by the cartel\'s output ceilings, supply discipline becomes harder to enforce. Several energy analysts on Wednesday revised their year-end gasoline forecasts downward.',
      'For the cartel itself, the question is whether this is a one-off or the start of a pattern. Several smaller members have grumbled about quotas for years; the UAE\'s exit gives those grumbles a precedent.'

    summary: 'Elon Musk took the stand on day one of the high-profile trial over OpenAI\'s for-profit conversion, arguing that the company abandoned its non-profit mission.',
    body: [
      'The trial that crypto Twitter, AI Twitter, and ordinary boardrooms have been waiting on for nine months kicked off in California this week, with Elon Musk taking the stand on day one to lay out the case that OpenAI abandoned the non-profit mission he says he helped fund and structure.',
      'Musk\'s testimony was characteristic — equal parts technical, personal, and rhetorically loaded. He argued that the company\'s pivot to a capped-profit structure, and the subsequent transition rumors, amount to converting a charitable mission into a private windfall. "Not OK," he said, "to steal a charity."',
      'OpenAI\'s legal team pushed back hard. The company has framed its evolution as a pragmatic response to compute costs that no non-profit balance sheet could realistically absorb, and argued that the non-profit\'s charter and the resulting structure are misrepresented in the plaintiff\'s case.',
      'For the AI industry, the stakes are higher than the headline trial drama suggests. A ruling against OpenAI on key counts would set a precedent that ripples through every major lab\'s legal entity stack. A ruling in OpenAI\'s favor would close a door that several rivals have been hoping was still open.'

    body: [
      'The Knicks delivered the kind of playoff statement game New York has been waiting for, dismantling the Hawks 127-97 at Madison Square Garden to take a 3-2 series lead. Jalen Brunson played his most complete postseason game of the year — the kind that reminded everybody what he is when the moment is right.',
      'The night belonged to the bench as much as the starters. Multiple reserves logged efficient minutes, the team\'s defensive switches were sharp from the opening minutes, and a third quarter that turned a competitive game into a runaway felt like the Knicks playing the role they imagined for themselves all season.',
      'The Hawks, for their part, had no answer for the perimeter pressure and could not generate the offensive rebounds they had been living on earlier in the series. Their bench in particular was outscored decisively.',
      'Game 6 shifts to Atlanta, where the home team will be playing for a season. The Knicks, meanwhile, will travel knowing that they need only one of the next two games — and that the Garden, win or lose, is waiting.'

    body: [
      'Roger Sweet, the toy designer widely credited with creating He-Man, has died at 91 after a long battle with dementia. The news was confirmed by family this week, ending a final chapter that had drawn an unusual outpouring of fan support over the past year.',
      'Sweet\'s creation became one of the most enduring cross-format brands of the late twentieth century, spawning toys, animation, comics, and now a planned new feature film. The original "Masters of the Universe" line shaped a generation of action figures and the merchandising economics that came with them.',
      'The fan response in his final months said as much about the man as the work. Online communities organized fundraisers, dropped off care packages, and sent letters in volumes that the family said gave him visible comfort even when his memory was uneven.',
      'A celebration of his life is being planned for later this spring. Tributes from former colleagues, fans, and the franchise\'s current rights-holders are already flooding the channels he helped invent.'

      'Pete Davidson knocked more than $100,000 off the asking price of his Westchester County home this week, weeks after first listing the property, as the comedian and SNL alum looks to move closer to his family on Staten Island.',
      'The reduction is modest in dollar terms but unmistakable in intent. Davidson and his team, by all reports, are not interested in dragging this listing through a long discovery period. They want a buyer.',
      'The home itself has been featured in multiple New York real-estate write-ups since it went on the market. The price cut comes against the backdrop of a softer-than-expected suburban market in the surrounding county and a sharp uptick in inventory across the broader tri-state area.',
      'Davidson\'s representatives declined to comment on the timing. The new asking price, agents in the area say, is now firmly in the range that should attract serious offers within weeks.'

      'Taylor Swift\'s legal team has filed paperwork seeking trademark protection over the singer\'s voice and likeness, an unusually aggressive personal-IP move that signals where the next phase of celebrity-vs-AI litigation is heading.',
      'The filings are targeted. They cover specific commercial uses — most notably synthetic vocal performances and likeness-based generative video — and are designed to give Swift\'s lawyers a sharper hammer against the wave of deepfake content that hit her earlier this year.',
      'For the broader music industry, the move is a template that other top-tier artists are already studying. Several major-label legal teams told reporters this week that they have been waiting for one of the genre\'s biggest names to make exactly this kind of filing.',
      'For the AI industry, the message is direct. The era of "we trained on whatever was on the internet" is closing fast, and the cost of generating a recognizable voice without authorization is about to get a lot more expensive.'
