                      Gemini today rolled out &ldquo;Agentic Trading,&rdquo; a new product that
                      wires AI models like ChatGPT and Claude directly into your crypto account.
                      Going live on April 27, 2026, the feature uses Anthropic&apos;s open Model
                      Context Protocol (MCP) to let an authorized AI agent monitor markets, place
                      trades, and manage risk under preset rules. Gemini calls it &ldquo;the first
                      agentic trading tool to be available directly through a regulated US-based
                      exchange.&rdquo;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The flow is simple: pick the agent you trust, set permissions, then review
                      and connect. The new dashboard exposes a three-step &ldquo;Connect.
                      Authorize. Automate.&rdquo; path, with granular toggles for what an agent
                      can actually do — view balances, view order history, place orders, edit
                      orders, and (off by default) withdraw funds. Users can pause, edit, or
                      revoke access at any time.
                    </p>

                    <InsetPanel heading="How it works under the hood">
                      <p>
                        Gemini has wired its full trading API into the MCP standard. Supported
                        models can request market data and call trading functions through that
                        bridge, then act inside the limits a user has set. The exchange also
                        shipped &ldquo;Trading Skills&rdquo; — modular functions an agent can
                        invoke, including &ldquo;Find the Spread&rdquo; (current bid-ask for any
                        pair) and &ldquo;Retrieve Candles&rdquo; (historical OHLC data for pattern
                        checks and backtesting). More skills are planned.
                      </p>
                    </InsetPanel>

                    <h2>Meet the Meme Agent: AI that trades the trend for you</h2>

                    <p>
                      Alongside a generic &ldquo;My Trading Agent,&rdquo; Gemini&apos;s
                      connected-agents list now showcases a dedicated Meme Agent — a purpose-built
                      AI for the messy, fast-moving memecoin corner of crypto. The pitch is
                      honest: most retail traders cannot watch X, Telegram and on-chain feeds at
                      3 a.m., but an agent can. With your rules, a Meme Agent can flag trending
                      tokens, evaluate liquidity, size in small, set a hard stop, and bail when
                      momentum dies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the official screenshot, &ldquo;Meme Agent&rdquo; sits right below
                      &ldquo;My Trading Agent&rdquo; in the Connected Agents panel — both showing
                      as Active, both labeled with last activity timestamps. The implication is
                      clear: agents are no longer one-size-fits-all. You can run a conservative
                      agent on your spot account and a tightly-leashed Meme Agent on a separate
                      sub-balance for memecoin trades, each with its own permissions.
                    </p>

                    <InsetPanel heading="What a Meme Agent can do for you">
                      <ul>
                        <li>Watch trending tickers across social and on-chain signals 24/7</li>
                        <li>Use &ldquo;Find the Spread&rdquo; before sizing — skip illiquid traps</li>
                        <li>Backtest patterns with &ldquo;Retrieve Candles&rdquo; before going live</li>
                        <li>Place orders only inside the position size and max-loss you set</li>
                        <li>Auto-exit on stop-loss, take-profit, or momentum reversal</li>
                      </ul>
                    </InsetPanel>

                    <h2>You stay in control</h2>

                    <p>
                      Gemini is leaning hard into the &ldquo;secure by design / always in
                      control&rdquo; framing. The Agent Permissions sidebar shows exactly which
                      capabilities are on (view balances, view order history, place orders, edit
                      orders) and which are off (withdraw funds is blocked by default). A
                      persistent footer reminds users: &ldquo;You can pause or revoke access at
                      any time.&rdquo;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      That matters because Agentic Trading lands during a wider push to give AI
                      agents real hands on real systems. Coinbase has backed x402 (an open
                      payments standard for AI bots, now under the Linux Foundation), and Tempo
                      is building MPP for machine-to-machine payments — both also use MCP.
                      Gemini&apos;s difference is that it brings agentic AI directly inside a
                      regulated exchange, not a wallet wrapper.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Limits, safety, and what the agent should not do</h2>

                    <p>
                      Letting an AI place real trades raises real questions: How do you stop a
                      model from chasing pumps? How do you cap a bad day? Gemini&apos;s answer is
                      the permissions UI plus Trading Skills that force the agent to look at
                      spreads and history before acting. Withdrawals being off by default is the
                      most important safety rail — even if the model is jailbroken or
                      hallucinates, it cannot drain the account.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Gemini frames the launch as the start of a category, not a one-off feature:
                      &ldquo;Agentic trading isn&apos;t just a feature.&rdquo; Expect more Trading
                      Skills, more agent templates (a Meme Agent today, perhaps a DCA Agent or
                      Hedging Agent tomorrow), and tighter MCP integrations with leading models.
                    </p>

                      BOOMER turns that premise on its head. This article is fictional and
                      satirical: it imagines a &ldquo;VanEck Old People ETF&rdquo; where the
                      beneficiaries are people 50 and up. Instead of investing in youth-first
                      disruption, BOOMER asks what happens when the theme is centered on
                      accumulated wealth, more mature spending patterns, and the way investors
                      typically allocate risk after age 50.

                      <p>
                        In this thought experiment, &ldquo;old people ETF&rdquo; does not mean
                        buying companies because they have pension plans. It means weighting
                        constituents toward companies expected to benefit from the 50+ cohort as
                        customers — and (in this playful methodology) toward companies whose
                        shareholder/customer profile is skewed toward investors aged 50+. In
                        short: BOOMER imagines an index with a demographic tilt, then rebalances
                        to keep the theme consistent.

                    <h2>Limits &amp; safety (because demographics can drift)</h2>

                    <p>
                      Even if the thesis sounds clean, demographic themes can change fast. Health
                      outcomes evolve, technology adoption among older users can accelerate or
                      slow, and a real implementation would struggle to measure &ldquo;who holds
                      the stock&rdquo; reliably. The safer design always includes diversification
                      and transparent risk controls.
                    </p>
