      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect the minimum information needed to run Wafer News and improve the reading
        experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Newsletter email.</strong> If you sign up for the daily briefing, we store the
          email address you submit so we can send you the newsletter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local preferences.</strong> Some preferences (such as your subscribed email) are
          stored in your browser&apos;s local storage. These never leave your device unless you
          sign up for a feature that requires them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Basic analytics.</strong> Like most websites, we collect aggregated, anonymized
          usage data — pages viewed, approximate region, browser type — to understand which
          stories resonate.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use the data above to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver the newsletter you signed up for.</li>
        <li>Remember your preferences across visits.</li>
        <li>Improve the product and prioritize editorial coverage.</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent abuse, spam and fraudulent activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information, and we do not share your email
        address with third parties for marketing.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Wafer News uses a small number of essential cookies and the browser&apos;s local
        storage. These keep you signed in to the newsletter, remember your preferences, and help
        diagnose errors. You can clear them at any time from your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Unsubscribe.</strong> Every newsletter email contains a one-click unsubscribe
          link. You can also clear your subscription on the site by clicking the &ldquo;Use a
          different email&rdquo; control under the success message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access &amp; deletion.</strong> Email{' '}
          <a href="mailto:privacy@dailyreports.example">privacy@dailyreports.example</a> to request
          a copy of the data we hold about you, or to ask us to delete it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opt-out of analytics.</strong> Most browsers offer a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo;
          setting and built-in privacy controls; we honor those signals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain newsletter email addresses for as long as you remain subscribed, plus a short
        period afterwards for record-keeping. Anonymized analytics may be retained for longer in
        aggregated form.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children</h2>
      <p>
        Wafer News is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect
        personal information from them. If you believe a child has signed up, please contact us
        and we will delete the account.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we
        will note them at the top of this page and update the &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date.
      </p>
