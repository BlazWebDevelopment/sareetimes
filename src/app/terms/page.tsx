      <h2>3. Newsletter</h2>
      <p>
        The Wafer News newsletter is provided as-is. We do our best to keep it timely and
        accurate, but we cannot guarantee delivery, formatting in every email client, or that
        every story will reach you. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in any email
        or by clearing your subscription on the site.
      </p>

      <h2>4. No professional advice</h2>
      <p>
        Wafer News is a news product. Nothing on the site is intended as financial, legal,
        medical, or other professional advice. Always do your own research and consult qualified
        professionals before making decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-party links</h2>
      <p>
        We sometimes link to third-party sites, services and embeds. Wafer News is not
        responsible for the content, accuracy, or privacy practices of those external services.

        We may suspend or terminate access to the service at any time, with or without notice, if
        we believe you have violated these terms or applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise these terms from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by
        updating the &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date at the top of this page. Continued use of
        the service after a change means you accept the new terms.
